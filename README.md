## Weekly CPD Reports

## Week One

First week back from a long summer spent working to try and keep myself fed and happy until the Student Finance loans come in
and make it a bit easier. This week I spent trying to get into the flow of University again and getting aquainted with the
new members of our team for the main game project. We all pitched different ideas of Game Worlds and had a variety of tastes
within the group. Despite this, my presentation skills still need work. I felt that I was able to say what I wanted but I was
going too fast trying to make sense even though most of the writing was on the slides. This is something that needs individual
attention and as such, could be tackled by getting used to talking in a group of people or spend more preperation on the 
material that I'm discussing.

## Week Two

Still getting used to the workflow with the sessions, so far so good. This week was when we started to plan potential ideas
for a Game within the team. Everyone had mixed opinions on everything that was brought up within the meeting. Nothing could
be set in-stone as each idea would be scrutinazed to the point of irrelevance and so began the tug-of-war. As such, I have
found myself to be frustrated because the meeting would be constantly looping between an idea and harsh criticism with no
solution or compromise, it left the other team-members stuck for words. I was mostly observing this and have tried to
get the meetings back on track by saying "Guys, we're going off-track, we should stay on topic" but this was ignored. To tackle this issue next time, I could address it with the SCRUM master and try to bring a solution forward instead of pure observation.

## Week Three

This week was the first to have a P.O meeting in which we could finally resolve some of the rifts happening in the group with
our Product Owner. In the meeting, we had a lot of art concepts done by the artists last week and had 3-4 prototype ideas that we agreed would be suitable to try to finally nail a game idea to work on for the duration of the module that everyone was happy with. A task that was very difficult for our team because of conflicting opinions in Game Design. This week I also missed out on
the Graphics lecture along with the workshop due to some sleeping issues that would result in not being able to resist the snooze temptation in the morning. However, I am worried that the comp220 is going to be a difficult module to get through if I
carry on the same way. To tackle this issue, I need to organize my time better to make sure that I attend the morning sessions
by consistently going to sleep at the same time and setting a few more alarms. 

## Week Four

In this week, we have finally decided on a prototype to continue working on as all of the prototypes that were created, were
play-tested by other people first. This was to be my downfall as my prototype wasn't up-to-par and this became apparent to me
during the play-test session which made me feel pretty bad but this was due to my own time-mismanagement and I just couldn't
get anything to go my way since it was a new engine which I am still getting to grips with. At the same time, I proposed 
what my comp220 project would be which is a First Person Scene/Interactable Physics Based Object with some sort of Rain
rendering on the screen. I don't have much prior experience with OpenGL but hope it goes well. The issue this week was
me managing my developement time poorly and as such, have dissapointed the team-members that wanted to continue develop
the prototype that I was working on. I under-performed massively and I hope that I haven't set a standard for things to come.
To hopefully fix this next time, I need to research a bit more into the engine before starting work on it as well as 
making time for actual development on the engine.

## Week Five

The game's actual identity is being cleared up and worked on throughout the course of the week with the Game dev people having
to pitch the game which I thought they did a good job on. I spent the morning polishing up things for the Interface Evaluation
that I was working on from last week as the deadline is on the Wednesday. I also failed to attend the Graphics lecture again
because of other deadlines taking over. I need to prioritize better. Also working on the referral for the Arduino task from
last year which I need help with.

## Week Six

Reading week instead of rest week. Yay for no holidays. This week, a lot of progress on the prototype was made. Having a clear
idea made it easier for other people to chime in and suggest other things to improve the game and make sure it is going in the
right direction. Following on from the studio practice, I had to review my Interface Evaluation via a Viva. I can't be the only
one that finds Vivas somewhat nerve-racking because of the setting and potential scrutiny the produced work will face. Some of it, I prepared for as I saw the faults in my work because of the way I collected the results from people, most of them had the
same thing written on them and as such, it was hard to do a heuristic evaluation on them. I need to make sure that I read the
briefs carefully and don't miss out on important points. If I had left a bit more time to grab other people to test my interface, this would have gone a lot smoother.

## Week Seven

Back to lectures. Mainly working on the game and the Ethics essay that is meant to be peer-reviewed towards the end
of the week. This time I made sure that some of referencing was improved and my chosen topic was concise. During the
Essay presentations, I was told that my question needs modifying to better suit the body of the essay. This feedback
was important because it made it easier to write as it was clear what I was going to be writing about, something that I
struggled with in the past is choosing an argument that I can't really debate with an essay.

## Week Eight

The Ethics essay is complete because I had spent extra time over the weekend improving it to make sure I get sufficient
feedback from the upcoming Peer Review for the essay itself. I feel like I am prioritizing well for the tasks that are
coming up but I still feel like I am falling behind on the comp220 module as I have failed to attend the earlier sessions
and as such being on-track with that module is out of the question as any session that I attend from this point,
doesn't relate to me because I keep getting stuck with issues that the module has already gone through or passed. Main issue here is the attendance and prioritizing difficult tasks above simpler ones but I'd rather focus on putting effort into something that I feel is achievable for me insead of a task that seems impossible for me. However, I should remember that not trying is even worse.

## Week Nine/Ten

Working on the game. Made progress with some of the platforms that I have been asked to develop as our game involves
platforming at fast speeds.Implementing moving platforms to work with a Target that the platform will go back and forth
from. This is the first iteration, in the future the team wants platforms that can move to different targets and 
the designers being able to choose those targets and such. Working with C# has been more difficult because the room
for error is very small and it is hard to identify where the error is because the whole thing will just not work. Need to
learn how to debug more efficently to assure I know where to look. In these couple of weeks, I also started the VR project
game that I needed to develop for the upcoming peer review. Having not utilized the prior sessions fully, I had to make sure
that whatever I was coming in to test, would work first time but it never does. Also made me realize that there aren't a lot of
resources available for SteamVR in terms fo actual development.

## Week Eleven

This week was spent mostly trying to damage control my comp220 project as I realized just how much I missed from the sessions.
At the same time though, I feel like my hands are tied because I simply don't know where to even start with this comlex task.
I attended this weeks session only to realize how screwed I really am and worse is that, none of my cohort are at the same point
and such asking for help being as far behind as I am would be meaningless as nobody would really want to help and it would only
serve as purpose of devaluing of my abilities as a so-called professional by other people. I feel like if I asked for help earlier, a lot of this could have been avoided but due to my own mistakes, I am once again in a predicament. 

## Week Twelve

Last week before we leave for the Christmas break. A lot of personal issues occured within the same time that I had to manage also. It has been difficult. Glad to be done for a while though but at the same time, will try to look into the Graphics
module over the holidays to see if I can make any improvements before the final submission. 

## Short summary

A lot of deadlines in a short amount of time has tested my ability to keep up with them and I believe that I did achieve that amidst the struggles. In retrospect, the same recurring theme of self-management needs to be tackled and as such, I have
picked up a book on time-management to hopefully aid me with that and give me something that I can take with me in the future.I just have to not forget that this is all a learning experience.
